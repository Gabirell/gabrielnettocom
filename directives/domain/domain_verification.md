- This is a security measure to prevent domain hijacking
- Your provider suspended the domain to force verification
- **This is normal and happens to everyone**

**Your Setup is Perfect:**
- All your DNS configuration is correct
- Domain protection is enabled
- Oracle instance is working
- Nothing needs to be reconfigured

**Once Verified:**
- Domain will work automatically
- This verification is valid for 1 year typically
- You won't need to do it again for a while
