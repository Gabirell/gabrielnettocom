There are three characters already built for my animations but my games dont use them.

1. is a cat (he is patient and smart, but lazy and too curious, he is kind and his motivation is curiosity and helping others, he loves luxury and comfort and its dream is to drive a car. His name is Kira)
2. is a dog (he is brave and strong, he is not conscious of his own strength and is always ready to help the cat and many times he is used by the cat to protect the rabbit and the house. He believes that the cat is the best and that he is a military hero in a mission of protection. His name is Max)
3. is a rabbit (he is hyperactive and causes a lot of trouble. He represents an autistic child, causing absurdist, funny and unexpected situations. He has an absurd humor and is always trying to do something different. His name is Rafa.)
4. is a bird (she is the anthagonist of the cat and rabbit, she is a bird that is always trying to steal the rabbit and the cat, but she is not a bad animal, she is just trying to survive and afraid of everyone, she is a bit coward and paranoid and besides flying is expert in technology. Her name is Fluttershy)

## 4. Budget for GPU Services

### 4.1 Monthly Rendering Budget
**Question**: What's your budget for 3D rendering and image generation?

Choose one:
- [ ] **R$ 0 only** - Free tier only (Colab, Kaggle) - slower, limited renders
- [ x] **R$ 50-100/month** - Occasional GPU bursts (5-10 hours rendering/month)
- [ ] **R$ 200-300/month** - Regular 3D work (20-30 hours/month)

**Comfort level**: Are you okay with per-render costs (e.g., R$ 0.88-7/hour as needed)?

- [ ] **No** - Prefer to stay 100% free if possible
- [x ] **Maybe** - Willing to pay for important renders only

### 4.2 3D Work Volume
**Question**: How much 3D content creation do you plan?

Estimate rough volume:
- Educational game characters: _none/8___ characters (e.g., 3-5?) My games are car games, hitting the correct place, etc. so I don't need characters yet. 
- Animation episodes: _2___ episodes in first 6 months (e.g., 1-3?)
- Other 3D projects: _I need to create assets for the games and animation series. I need to train models in my own drawings and design.____________________

## 5. Content Priorities

### 5.1 Phase 1 Focus (Weeks 2-6)
**Question**: Which site sections are MOST important to complete first?

Rank 1-6 (1 = highest priority):

- [ 4] ____ ARTS (gallery of artistic works)
- [ 2] ____ ABOUT (timeline and bio)
- [ 5] ____ BLOG (blog + social media automation)

**Reasoning** (optional): _____________________
As I already have a working app, the tragaverbos game, I think it's better to start with the games section.

## 8. Technology Preferences

### 8.1 Game Framework
**Question**: For educational games, which framework?

- [ ] **Phaser.js** (Web-only, easier, HTML5) - Recommended for MVP
- [ ] **Unity** (Cross-platform web+mobile, steeper curve)
- [ ] **Your choice** - I trust AI to pick best tool
- [ x] **Other**: I will prefer an engine that is easy to learn and has a good community, like Godot and maybe Unity in the future. Maybe Unreal Engine somewhere in the future. For now how about using three.js and react (or similiar)? Please look at my tragaverbos, Turbo Mates: Physics Blitz and Matamaticas on github to have a reference. the idea is to first build a game using this technology to get some funds and then we can build a game for mobile in the future. I don't have a lot of money to spend on this project, so i will do it as it grows. I dont know if you can access my links but I have some projects in gemini and google ai studio that you can look at: https://aistudio.google.com/apps/drive/1xqz7NhJD6BVzt-UxB7Cmu9C2Z-7JXVu8?showPreview=true&showAssistant=true. 
https://aistudio.google.com/apps/drive/1TtzFVxx9PzlmwY6TLFDcL_nyvQ754Dqv?showPreview=true&showAssistant=true

### 8.2 Mobile Apps (Future)
**Question**: For Phase 5 (mobile expansion), which platform first?

- [ x] **Android** (Google Play) - Easier to publish, lower cost
- [ ] **iOS** (App Store) - Requires $99/year developer account
- [ ] **Both simultaneously**
- [ ] **Not planning mobile** (web only is fine)

## 9. Open Questions

**Question**: Anything else I should know before starting?

- Specific design preferences: I love retro style, so please try to keep it simple and minimalistic, but also fun and engaging. I also love animations between pages, sections and intereface changes. For example if you want to change the color of the background, please animate it. The same goes for lateral lines and other interface elements. 
- Technical constraints:It is importatn to keep the website simple and easy to navigate. I also want to have code organizated and documentated for easy understanting and future maintenance.
- Concerns or questions: If possible make it as secure as possible, using .env files to store sensitive information and using HTTPS. Also use docker to containerize the application when possible. Never hard code sensitive information, specially api keys and passwords. I'm worried about costs, so please check if there is something that can be done to reduce costs and make it as affordable as possible. Please warn me when the costs of the site are going to reach 100 BRL per month with all operations included. Always try to use free services when possible, and when I use paid services, please warn me about the costs and the benefits of using them and store them in a database for easy access and analysis. Show me the total costs when i'm in admin panel.
- Exciting ideas to incorporate: please try to incorporate new and exciting ideas to the website, such as AI chatbot, 3D models, animations, etc when possible and when it makes sense. Make the admin panel as simple as possible but mantaining a retro look. I want to work from there as much as possible. If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. Also make the ai recognice when I log in and give me important information about the website and user main uses and actions. Please make it give me advice and ideas to improve the website, user experience and functionality to get more visits and users.
